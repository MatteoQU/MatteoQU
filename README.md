## Hi there 👋
My name is Matteo Donagemma and I am a student at Macquarie University.

- 🇮🇹🇬🇧 I am extremely fluent in Italiano and English.
  - Ⓡ I am NOT fluent in R
- 📞 How to reach me: If you need to reach me then it's likely you already know me 🤷‍♂️
  -  Or rather you won't need to reach me through GitHub 🖥️
- ❓ Fun fact: I used to live in the Netherlands! 🇳🇱
